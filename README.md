# Pre-work - *Memory Game*

**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **Catherine Kang**

Time spent: **5** hours spent in total

Link to project: https://glitch.com/edit/#!/codepath--prework
## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ ] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [ ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [ ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [ ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [ ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [ ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] I added sounds effects for when you win and lose the game. I'm not sure if the noise was able to pick up during the recording of the gif though.

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here. 
[YOUR ANSWER HERE]

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
[I have never used any of the programming languages, so learning how the languages work and interact with each other was a fun challenge. I actually started a web programming class at my school, so I will learn more about HTML, javascript, and CSS. However, there have only been two lectures so I have not obtained any knowledge that I could use for this project. This game was a great introduction for me to see what is to come in learning how web programming works. The main challenge in this submission was learning how the three files interact with each other and how each one contributes to creating the final product. The step–by-step guide to create the game was a useful tool to begin to understand the purpose of each file. The html file is the main file where the objects of the game are created while the CSS file is where the aesthetics of  objects are changed. I learned the jss file is where the logic of the game can be created, and most of the time I was switching between the html and jss file to code the game. Some specific challenges I faced were learning how to keep an image hidden until a button is clicked as well as figuring out how to include different audio for the buttons when I created the mystery reveal of Super Mario characters. Most questions I have about code have already been asked by other users on stackoverflow which is where I went to figure out how to hide an image on a button and change the noises of them. Seeing the answers from other people helped me to see how important the jss file is because it is not only where the workings of the game is written but also useful in creating changes to the buttons. ]

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[This project has made me more excited to take my web programming class and experience how coding can create a new product that I have yet to try making before. I’m curious about the diverse range of creations that can be made from web development. The Internet can aid in so many purposes such as communication, education, and entertainment. I want to learn about what to develop to help serve people’s need for the Internet. I also wonder about how web development is related to other computer science ideas I have been learning about in my classes. Some questions I have is how do data structures and  big-O play a role in web development? As an end user, I don’t put a lot of effort in figuring out how to navigate a website if it is designed well. How do web developers figure out  what features should be created in a project to best serve the purpose of the website and be easily accessible for the user? ]

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
[I would continue to create a more complete game. A cool idea I would want to try out is having the block shuffle after each turn because since the buttons are stationary, it can get easy to memorize the pattern based on the placement of the buttons rather than focusing on the sound and colors of the blocks to memorize it. I also wanted to have a background sound playing since almost all games have background music which creates an association between a game and a song. Adding a timer or clock to increase the difficulty of the game is a very interesting idea to figure because there are so many parts that must be included like thinking about how much time should be given for guessing, how to show the clock on the screen, and adding a noise when the player is running out of time.]
